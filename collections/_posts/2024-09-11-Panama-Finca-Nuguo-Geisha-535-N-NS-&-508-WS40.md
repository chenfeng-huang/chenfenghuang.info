Nuguo Estate is one of my favorite producers of Panamanian Geisha coffee. What makes their coffee special is its outstanding and complex flavor profile while maintaining remarkable cleanliness, without excessive fermentation notes. Due to their limited production, their green beans stay high in the market. I feel fortunate to have acquired both their 535-N-NS (Natural Processed) and 508-WS40 (Washed Processed) lots this year for comparison.

As expected, the natural processed beans far surpass the washed ones in terms of sweetness. The washed process beans exhibit more white floral notes and Earl Grey tea characteristics, sharing similarities with La Esmeralda estate. While the overall flavor profile is elegantly subtle, its price point might raise questions about value for money. The natural processed beans, on the other hand, deliver distinct sweet orange juice notes. When extracted with multiple-stage brewing at higher ratios, clear strawberry sweetness emerges, accompanied by a lasting sweet aftertaste. Although still commanding a premium price, it truly delivers value proportional to its cost - you get what you pay for.
