I am pleased to announce that our paper, “Effective Series Decomposition and Components Learning for Time Series Generation,” has been accepted as a regular paper at ICDM 2025. Out of 786 total submissions, only 106 were accepted as regular papers, resulting in a highly selective full-paper acceptance rate of 13.5%.

I am grateful that our efforts have paid off and look forward to presenting in Washington, D.C.
