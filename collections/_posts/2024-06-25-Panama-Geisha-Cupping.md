    This was my first time participating in a coffee cupping, and I was fortunate to experience a wide range of top-tier Geishas from Panama. When I first got into coffee, Geisha felt like an unattainable rarity, so this session gave me a much more complete perspective on the varietyâ€”almost a kind of "demystification."
    <br><br>
    I could clearly perceive the common white floral notes shared among the Geishas. The berry-like aromas were more apparent in the dry fragrance, but during tasting and in the wet aroma I wasn't able to distinguish many differences. It showed me that my sensory skills in coffee evaluation still have plenty of room to improve.
