Under mentor Ye Kuang's guidance, I successfully earned both the **SCA CSP Sensory-Professional Certificate** and the **CVA (Coffee Value Assessment) Certificate**. 

The SCA Sensory-Professional certification provided me with advanced knowledge in sensory evaluation techniques, including cupping protocols, flavor identification, and coffee quality assessment. This certification covers the science behind taste perception, sensory panel management, and standardized evaluation methods used in the specialty coffee industry.

The CVA certificate complements this by focusing on the commercial aspects of coffee quality assessment and value determination. CVA training encompasses market-oriented coffee evaluation, understanding how sensory qualities translate to commercial value, and the ability to assess coffee from both quality and business perspectives.

Together, these certifications have equipped me with comprehensive skills to evaluate coffee from both scientific and commercial standpoints. I look forward to applying these advanced sensory and assessment skills in my continued coffee journey.
